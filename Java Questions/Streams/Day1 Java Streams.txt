Problem 1 — Filter Even Numbers

Statement:
You are given a list of integers representing daily website visit counts. Some values are odd and some even.
Write a method getEvenNumbers(List<Integer> numbers) that returns a new list containing only the even numbers, using Java Streams.

Example Input:
[10, 15, 22, 7, 30]
Expected Output:
[10, 22, 30]

Problem 2 — Convert Words to Their Lengths

Statement:
You are given a list of words typed by users into a search bar.
Write a method mapWordsToLength(List<String> words) that converts each word into its corresponding length and returns a list of integers.

Example Input:
["java", "developer", "stream"]
Expected Output:
[4, 9, 6]

Problem 3 — Remove Duplicate Integers

Statement:
Given a list of integers representing product IDs viewed by a user (the list may contain duplicates),
write a method removeDuplicates(List<Integer> ids) that returns a list of unique IDs, preserving the original order.

Example Input:
[4, 5, 4, 7, 5, 9]
Expected Output:
[4, 5, 7, 9]

Problem 4 — Find Maximum and Minimum

Statement:
Given a list of integers representing scores in a coding challenge,
write a method findMinMax(List<Integer> scores) that returns a pair (min, max) using streams.

You may define:

a custom Pair class, or

return a list/array of size 2, or

return an OptionalInt[].

Example Input:
[40, 10, 90, 70, 20]
Expected Output:
min = 10, max = 90

Problem 5 — Calculate Sum and Average

Statement:
You are given a list of integers representing monthly expenses.
Write a method calculateSumAndAverage(List<Integer> expenses) using Java Streams to compute:

The sum of all elements

The average (as double)

Return them as a custom object or a pair.

Example Input:
[1000, 1500, 1200, 1800]
Expected Output:
sum = 5500, average = 1375.0
